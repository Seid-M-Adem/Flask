Flask app using Python

The HTML response in the index route includes a form with input fields for entering the first number (x) and the second number (y), as well as a dropdown menu for selecting the operation (operation).
The input fields have placeholder attributes to provide a hint to the user about what information should be entered.
When the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to the /calc endpoint with the entered values, where the calculation is performed.
